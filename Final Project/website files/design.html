<h2>Massively Multiplayer Online Games</h2>
<p>
MMOs are perhaps some of the most popular games. They involve massive worlds with thousands of player occupying them. MMOs specialize in giving players the opportunity to socialize. They also allow players great ways to team up and battle, explore, or complete quests together. It's the ultimate game type for social interaction.
</p>
<h2>Real-Time Strategy Games</h2>
<p>
RTS games are for people who love to think and plan. The most known example of an RTS is Starcraft II. Players compete against one another building up an army while managing all of their resources and bases. It's a great platform for competitive games as well as giving people a creative outlet, letting them build their world.
</p>
<h2>Roleplay Games</h2>
Lastly Roleplay games. RPG's main goal is often to tell a story, almost like watching a movie. Skyrim is one of the best examples of this. It tells a story, but then also allows massive amounts of exploration, customization, as well as skill leveling.
